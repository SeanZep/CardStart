                            A conversation should always be a two-way street. Take your time to truly listen and respond to others. Absorb what they’re sharing and then share your thoughts respectfully.

                            Going along with truly listening, it’s best to put away all other distractions, such as phones. You want to be present in your conversation and the moment.
